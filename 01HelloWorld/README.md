## Getting started with Jenkins

Mantaining a good order and a naming convention can help in making things easier to find and fix in the future. In this guide we'll learn how to create Jenkins Folders and Jenkins Jobs.<br/>

## Creating a Folder
There are few things as useful as a virtual Folder. In Jenkins likewise many other tools and OS we have the option to create Folders for specific purposes, where our pipelines will happily live.

### My First Folder
Once Jenkins is up and running on your machine click on the "New Item" option on the left hand panel.

Inside New Item screen we'll need to define a name (don't forget to use a naming convention) and Folder as type. Once those details are ready just click "Ok" button to finish.
